# Project Name
Purrrrgatory
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2021

## Theme
Every Death Counts

Our game features a cat stuck in "purrrrgatory," wherein it has to collect each of it's eight other lives in order to ascend into the afterlife. If the player has not spoken to and collected all eight of the cat's lives, the cat cannot ascend, therefore instituting the idea that every death counts toward success in the game. 

## Game Play
The objective of the game is to get your cat out of "purrrgatory" by speaking to and collecting each of it's eight other lives. 
Uses standard WASD keys--tap W for light jump, hold W down for long jump, D to go forward, A to go back. Press the space bar to continue dialogue.

## Impediments
Syncing new instrument with the addition of a cat; smooth movement that isn't ruined if you do it at the end of speaking with a cat; designing levels to where it wasn't totally impossible to complete (jumps not being feasible, including platforms so falling isn't as much of an issue); background size.

1. original animated sprites
2. WASD controls
3. different levels of jumping
4. player input when naming cat
5. dialogue using Dialogic 
6. original music that adds an instrument with every cat you collect

13. original platforms (3 designs) 
14. final cutscene
