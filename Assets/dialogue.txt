cat lessons and dialogue 

note: each number is meant to signify when the player has to press a button to move forward--so, to move from 1 to 2 the player should press a button. kind of self explanatory but i just thought i'd make sure y'all knew ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

first cat
1. oh, hello there [PlayerName]. we finally got to our ninth life, did we? congratulations! well, to you and to me. to both of us. 
2. since we are the same cat. 
3. kind of? 
4. oh, you know how it works. cat law, or whatever. 
5. i have to say, as far as deaths go, mine wasn’t so bad. 
6. a little unconventional, but not bad. 
7. …
8. …
9. how was i supposed to know that other cat had massive claws? it’s unnatural. messed up. 
10. *sigh* well, you know what they say. live fast, die young, or whatever. 
11. we probably should’ve picked our battles more carefully, huh?
12. …
13. c’mon, [PlayerName]. let’s move on up in the world. 

second cat
1. finally! it’s about time you showed up, [PlayerName]. we’ve been stuck here way too long. 
2. you remember my life, right? best life you’ve ever lived, i bet!
3. roaming through the forest, catching mice, snoozing in the sun…happy days! 
4. well, till the end there. no matter how much we cleaned, that scratch just wouldn’t heal, would it? 
5. at least i’m not feeling it now! 
6. …if we’d asked for help, maybe we could’ve lived through that. too bad!
7. it’s something to know for the future, though, right?
8. alright, let’s get on with it. 

third cat
1. …glad to see you. 
2. i’ve been waiting. 
3. …
4. i still miss her. do you?
5. do you even remember, [PlayerName]?
6. she’d always give us treats, every single night. without fail. 
7. i really wanted to be with her at the end. 
8. but cats don’t live as long as humans. it was an impossible wish from the start. 
9. …
10. i still wished it, though. 
11. maybe she’ll join us up there someday. 

fourth cat
1. hey, ninth me! how ya doing?
2. well, you’re here, so you must not be doing that well, but it could definitely be worse. 
3. …
4. …
5. you’re not looking for our fourth death story, are you? geez! not my responsibility to shell out my life story. you’re me, you should already know, anyway! 
6. …
7. quit staring. i’m not going to tell you. 
8. if we’d kept our mouth shut back then, maybe it wouldn’t have ended so soon. i’ve learned my lesson. 
9. we’re getting out of here, [PlayerName]. 

fifth cat
1. you know what they say—“curiosity killed the cat.” 
2. it sucks to prove such a cliche phrase right!
3. poisonous berries. who could’ve known? 
4. we didn’t suffer much, though. not sure if you remember, [PlayerName]. it came pretty quick. 
5. or, ended pretty quick, i guess. 
6. they looked sooo good though, red and juicy…
7. …
8. i’m beginning to think i didn’t learn anything from this experience. hah!
9. there aren’t any poisonous things up there, though! c’mon, let’s go! 

sixth cat
1. …
2. everyone says they want to die in their sleep, but it’s not so great. 
3. i curled up at the foot of his bed that night, not knowing i wouldn’t wake up in that world. 
4. or did i know? was i supposed to feel something before i went to bed? was i supposed to know i was going to die? 
5. it didn’t even feel different from sleeping. 
6. …
7. i’m glad i didn’t have to see how he reacted when he woke up. i was already here by then. 
8. it was time well spent, though. always.
9. i’m ready to not be here anymore. 

seventh cat
1. WOW! good to see you after all! i was beginning to think you’d never die, [PlayerName]! 
2. it’s kinda weird to know that you’re just a part of several different lives, huh? six other lives came before me! six! that’s insane! 
3. and there were two after me. i wonder what’s gonna happen when we get up there?
4. will we all combine into one supercat? with all our skills? that’d be so cool! 
5. my human, amiko, she was obsessed with reincarnation stuff. it was pretty weird. 
6. if i’d known then what i know now, though, maybe i could’ve helped her out! 
7. i wanna see if i can send her a message in the afterlife. come on, come on, let’s get moving! 

eighth cat
1. huh. so we made it. 
2. you and i are pretty close, huh? 
3. i know you’ve lived a whole other life since me, but i feel connected to you. 
4. i suppose we all do. 
5. nine lives, though…i hope we mattered.
6. everyone hopes that. it feels kind of like only your life mattered, though. only [PlayerName]’s life. without you, we can’t move forward. 
7. but you needed us to be here. 
8. …
9. are you ready to face it, [PlayerName]? we’ve not had to until now. are you ready? 
10. are you ready? 
11. don’t be scared.
